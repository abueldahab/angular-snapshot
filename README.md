angular-snapshot
================

Distributed node-webkit program that watches for websites to screenshot and capture html to post to a hook.  Excellent for AngularJS, EmberJS, Backbone, or etc.

## Vision

A distributed way to create screenshots and capture the html of a javascript SPA app.  It accepts a firebase url so you can either run this yourself when you need to or POST into the main firebase db and take advantage of someone else running this program.

## Usage

1. Drop node-webkit.app into the root of this project.
2. Double click that executable or rune `open node-webkit.app` from terminal.

Please be aware that this is very new.  Any feedback would be much appreciated.

## Downloads

Builds for Linux (32|64) bit, Mac, and Windows coming once the api is stable.
