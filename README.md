angular-snapshot
================

Distributed node-webkit program that watches for websites to screenshot and capture html to post to a hook.  Excellent for AngularJS, EmberJS, Backbone, or etc.

## Vision

A distributed way to create screenshots and capture the html of a javascript SPA app.  It accepts a firebase url so you can either run this yourself when you need to or POST into the main firebase db and take advantage of someone else running this program.

If you have a computer that's on all the time you can contribute to the community by running this.

## Usage

This project is based on: https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit

1. Drop node-webkit.app into the root of this project.
2. Double click that executable or rune `open node-webkit.app` from terminal.

Please be aware that this is very new.  Any feedback would be much appreciated.

## Downloads

Builds for Linux (32|64) bit, Mac, and Windows coming once the api is stable.
